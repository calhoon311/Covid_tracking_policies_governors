# Covid_tracking_policies_governors

This notebook uses Python to analysis Covid data. I used four different data sets and merged them together with python. One was Covid tracking data that showed numbers
states and their cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and more. There was policy data for each state and what polices they put in place with start and end dates at both county
and state level. I also wanted to look at states' governors and what political party they are apart of and if that made any impact. The last was population data and the estimated 
2019 population for each state so I could convert numbers based on rates. After combining and making one data set, I justed python to make graphs and charts to analize data.
